Hey! This is the 3rd site I have ever made amd I'm pretty proud of it. I used HTML CSS and a lot of vanilla JavaScript. My decision for that was even though there are a number of great JS libraries that would work, they're all based off of JS. I'm also relatively new to Web Development, so I wanted to give myself the best shot of understanding the code and how it works. This site is best viewed on a laptop or desktop screen, especially since I made this site for potential employers.I really learned a lot doing this project and I am very excited to be able to improve upon it as I do. Thanks for coming to visit my tiny corner of the internet. Have a great day!
